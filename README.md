# english-russian.github.io

A try to explain my vision of English Grammar.
I hope to make this page useful as a minimum for my friends who want to improve their English Grammar.

In case you decide to discuss something - you can connect to a community https://slofile.com/slack/english-russian
There are a lot of people already connected but no one has a clue what to discuss :)
I suppose you can bring a fresh breath to there.
