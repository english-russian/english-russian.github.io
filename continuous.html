        <h2>How to make Continuous from Present, Past and Future tenses.</h2>
        <p>The main thing about converting Present, Past, and Future SIMPLE tenses
           into Continuous tense is that we just have to use verb "to be" add -ing ending
           in the end of the main verb. And for the perfect tenses we use have + been + ing form of the main verb.:</p>
        <p>The formulas for Continuous tenses are:</p>
        <p>For Present Simple Continuous:  Subject + to be + Verb(1rd form)-ing  + Object</p>
        <p>For Past Simple Continuous:     Subject + to be (past) + Verb(1rd form)-ing  + Object</p>
        <p>For Future Simple Continuous:   Subject + will + be + Verb(1rd form)-ing  + Object</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For Present Perfect Continuous: Subject + have + been + Verb(1rd form)-ing  + Object</p>
        <p>For Past Perfect Continuous:    Subject + had  + been + Verb(1rd form)-ing  + Object</p>
        <p>For Future Perfect Continuous:  Subject + will + have been + Verb(1rd form)-ing  + Object</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, from the above formulas you can see that we can transform all tenses from base tense to continuous:
        <p>In the formula for Present Simple (Subject + Verb (1st form) + _/s(es) + Object) we just add
           "to be" verb and transform Verb (1st form) into Gerund (-ing).
        <p>In the formula of the Present Perfect we just adding "been" and the again transform
           Verb (1st form) into Gerund (-ing).
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So here, from all above you can see all the differences between all of the English tenses</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <p>Present Simple:             I <b>run</b> every morning.</p>
        <p>Present Simple Continuous:  I <b>am running</b> to a park at the moment.</p>
        <p>Past Simple:                I <b>walked</b> yesterday.</p>
        <p>Past Simple Continuous:     I <b>was running</b> when she called.</p>
        <p>Future Simple:              I <b>will run</b> tomorrow morning.</p>
        <p>Future Simple Continuous:   I <b>will be running</b> tomorrow at 9 A.M.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Present Perfect:            I <b>have coocked</b> a soup</p>
        <p>Present Perfect Continuous: I <b>have been coocking</b> the soup for an hour already.</p>
        <p>Past Perfect:               I <b>had cooked</b> the soup when already you drank all my cola.</p>
        <p>Past Perfect Continuous:    I <b>had been cooking</b> your soup while you were drinking my cola.</p>
        <p>Future Perfect:             I <b>will have cooked</b> your soup before you drink all cola</p>
        <p>Future Perfect Continuous:  I <b>will have been cooking</b> the soup tomorrow at 11 A.M.</p>
