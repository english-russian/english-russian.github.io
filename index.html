          <p>This page is one for thous who would like to get more confident in English
             grammar tenses. I post here my thoughts, experience and links I used to help
             others. Many articles about English grammar starts from defining all 12 tenses
             with additional things like Future in the past, gerunds and so on. And many
             people from thous who I know say - WOW!!! I'll never learn all that stuff. I
             prefer to tell that it's only one point of view and I think it differently.
             Firstly let's assume that Future and Past versions are only mutations of present
             tenses, so we can start from studying only <b>FOUR</b> Present tenses:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Present Simple</li>
              <li>Present Continuous</li>
              <li>Present Perfect</li>
              <li>Present Perfect Continuous</li>
          </ul>
          <p>PLUS only about two rules:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>"How to make Future from present tense"</li>
              <li>"How to make Past from present tense"</li>
          </ol>

          <p>But! If you look carefully on the list above, you'll find out that there is
             a regularity that could help us more. Now we can describe main English Grammar
             Tenses as:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><a href="./present_simple.html">Present Simple</a></li>
              <li><a href="./present_perfect.html">Present Perfect</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>PLUS only about THREE rules:</p>
          <ol>
              <li><a href="./future.html">"How to make Future from present tense"</a></li>
              <li><a href="./past.html">"How to make Past from present tense"</a></li>
              <li><a href="./continuous.html">"How to make Continuous from any tense above :)"</a></li>
          </ol>

          <p>So in my PERSONAL opinion, it's as a minimum much simpler to remember only
             two tenses and three rules which make from these two - TWELVE :) Another very
             important thing that no one told me by the school time, is that English is more
             from math than from literature :) Because if we take some exceptions as minor,
             then we can say that any English sentence is similar to a math formula. So to
             learn English you should more be a mathematical thinking person but not a humanitarian.</p>

          <p>While writing this manual I have found a very useful table of the English Grammar Tenses.
             In My Humble Opinion, it demonstrates very well when and which tense to use.
             I found it on the site <a href="https://www.yourskypeschool.com">www.yourskypeschool.com</a>
             but I didn't use their service yet, so I placed the link here just to mention that
             it isn't mine but I found it very useful.</p>
